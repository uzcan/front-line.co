title: "14th year of FrontLine Co."

By the feedback from you, we have made our products more accessible but never compromising from their high quality. In addition, we increased the number of models of our AC Camera to 5 to make the products appeal to wider audiences. FL AC Camera models we just released have a 7.0 P/Q rating, while our UAV Drone models have a P/Q level of 6.7 in Year 14. The reason we go for balancing at the P/Q level is to make high quality FrontLine products presented to larger audiences.
