title: "Year 14"

With the feedback from you, we have made our product more accessible but never compromising on its high quality. In addition, we increased the number of models of our camera to 5 to make the product appeal to wider audiences. The camera we just released had a 7.0 P / Q level, while our drone had a P / Q level of 6.7 in Year 14. The reason we go for balancing at the P / Q level is to show the quality of our product to larger audiences.
